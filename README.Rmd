## Overview

An [R](http://r-project.org) package of spatial map layers for British Columbia.

## Features

Provides access to various spatial layers of British Columbia, such as 
administrative boundaries, natural resource management boundaries, watercourses etc. 
All layers are available as `sf` or `Spatial` objects in the
[BC Albers](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/nad83-bc-albers/) projection, which is the [B.C. Government standard](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hts/risc/pubs/other/mappro/index.htm). 

Layers are stored in the [bcmaps.rdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcmaps.rdata) package 
and loaded by this package, following the strategy recommended by [Anderson and Eddelbuettel](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-026/index.html). 

## Installation

The package is not available on CRAN, but can be installed from github: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/bcmaps", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
## Usage

To get full usage of the package, you will also need to install the [**bcmaps.rdata**](https://github.com/bcgov/bcmaps.rdata) package, which holds 
all of the datasets.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('bcmaps.rdata', repos='https://bcgov.github.io/drat/')
```

To see the layers that are available, run the `available_layers()` function:

```{r}
library(bcmaps)
available_layers()
```

Most layers are accessible by a shortcut function by the same name as the object. 
Then you can use the data as you would any `sf` or `Spatial` object. For example:
```{r}
library(sf)

bc <- bc_bound()
plot(st_geometry(bc))
```

Alternatively, you can use the `get_layer` function - simply type `get_layer('layer_name')`, 
where `'layer_name'` is the name of the layer of interest. The `get_layer` function is
useful if the back-end `bcmaps.rdata` package has had a layer added to it, but there is 
as yet no shortcut function created in `bcmaps`.

```{r}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

ws <- get_layer("watersheds", class = "sf")

plot(ws["SRCNM"], key.pos = NULL)
```

### Simple Features objects
By default, all layers are returned as [`sf` spatial objects](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf):

```{r plot-maps, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
library(bcmaps)
library(sf)

# Load and plot the boundaries of B.C.

bc <- bc_bound()
plot(st_geometry(bc))

## Next load the Regional Districts data, then extract and plot the Kootenays
rd <- regional_districts()
kootenays <- rd[rd$ADMIN_AREA_NAME == "Regional District of Central Kootenay", ]
plot(st_geometry(kootenays), col = "lightseagreen", add = TRUE)
```

### Spatial (sp) objects

If you aren't using the `sf` package and prefer the old standard [`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp)
way of doing things, set `class = "sp"` in either `get_layer` or the shortcut functions:

```{r watercourses, warning=FALSE}
library("sp")
# Load watercourse data and plot with boundaries of B.C.
plot(get_layer("bc_bound", class = "sp"))
plot(watercourses_15M(class = "sp"), add = TRUE)
```

### Vignettes

We have written a short vignette on plotting points on one of the layers from `bcmaps`.
You can view the vignette online [here](/vignettes/add_points.md) or if you installed the package using `devtools::install_github("bcgov/bcmaps", build_vignettes = TRUE)` you can open it using `browseVignettes("bcmaps")`.

### Utility Functions

The package also contains a couple of handy utility functions:

1. `fix_geo_problems()` for fixing invalid topologies in `sf` or `Spatial` objects 
such as orphaned holes and self-intersections
2. `transform_bc_albers()` for transforming any `sf` or `Spatial` object to 
[BC Albers](https://epsg.io/3005) projection.
3. `self_union()` Union a `SpatialPolygons*` object with itself to remove overlaps, while retaining attributes
